# Estimation-of-Food-Calories
This project is determined to find the calories present in image captured that contains food items.

VolumeDetection.py would result in desired output but would combine all the similar food items.
Its recommended to have a 5-rupee coin only, beside the food which is useful to determine the mass
If there are 2 apples and 1 orange in an image, then the output shall be combined calories present in 2 apples.
Whereas in VolumeDetection1.py, individual food items' calories are displayed. 
food_cnn.py is for training and food_predict.py is for testing. 
Values.py is helpful in printing the most probable food item. For training model, start off with food_cnn.py. 
You must build the training model on your own.
I suggest you to find the dataset of food items which have the images captured from all the angles.Its found here-https://www.kaggle.com/moltean/fruits
As its a huge dataset, we have only trained with 3 food items to our requirement and hence I didn't share the training model.
All the best!!
If you have any issues/doubts, u can post the same at issues

Thank You
